## Property Inspector assets

The manifest and project file both reference Property Inspector pages under `PropertyInspector/StarCitizen/`, but the live, editable sources are kept in the **`starcitizen/PropertyInspector/StarCitizen/`** folder (the one the plugin actually packages). No HTML lives here; the old duplicate `ActionDelay.html` was removed to avoid conflicting edits. This placeholder folder remains only to steer contributors to the canonical location and to prevent confusion with legacy template content that used to live at the repo root.
